=== Coding requirement ===

- asp.net9.0.9 + razor page style
- bootstrap 5.3.8
- pure js
- ajax/fetch() + mapping endpoints (app.mappost(), app.mapget()) to avoid page reload flickering.
- fully nullable enabled c#.
- separate js scripts and css from view page to be class --> member-edit.js and member-edit.css.
- implement .js and .css in the very bottom of index.cshtml like this
 @section Scripts { <script src="~/js/member.js" asp-append-version="true"></script> }
 @section Styles { <link href="~/css/member.css" asp-append-version="true" rel="stylesheet" /> }

Hello, would you help me expand user index page to have editable feature in the same page, please?

*** Goal ***
- User click edit -> replace edit with save | cancel.
- Click photo icon -> allow user to browse new image file (.jpg, .png, etc..) -> refresh photo for review.
- User can drop image file in to any area in their row -> refresh photo for review..
- User can browse or drop image file multiple times before click save.
- After click save
   : validate image file size > 5MB = reject + alert user.
   : if image dimension height < 160px = reject + alert user.
   : if image ratio (w:h) > 6.0f --> trim left - right to make ratio 6.0f maximum.
   : resize image to height 160px maintain image ratio.
   : convert image to jpg + compress image file 80% + fill background white.
   : save jpg image file to "wwwroot/appdata/member/picture/{guid}.jpg"
   : update user new email and new jpg file name ({guid}.jpg w/o path) to database (AppDbContext -> db.Users)
   : delete old user image file if exists (known old image file name from db.Users)
   : if user click cancel --> reverse back all email and photo.
   : extra css on edit mode --> make user photo larger 48x48px center-vertical in their row + maintain row height (you have to adjust img or tr/td padding or what ever to maintain row height not different than other normal row)
- I have ImageHelper class to support this for you, please review if it could use to implement immedietly.

*** I would like you help apply the change to these source files and send the update to me. ***
